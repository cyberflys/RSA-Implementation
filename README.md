# RSA-Implementation
My implementation of RSA algorithm (shitty with bigger numbers lol)


Kinda watched how to do it for two days.
<br>Just wanted to practice , and that's what i did</br>

<h1>Don't get me wrong , i just wanted to practice for a bit.</h1>
<br> Run with : python3 rsa.py -e {string} </br>
<br> if you run it like this , it will encrypt that string and make private and public keys.</br>
<br> Run with : python3 rsa.py -d {string}  {private key} </br>
<br> if you run it like this , it will decrypt the string using private key and print it.</br>
