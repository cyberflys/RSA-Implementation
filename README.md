# RSA-Implementation
My implementation of RSA algorithm (shitty with bigger numbers lol)



<br>Gave myself a challenge to test my skills.
<br>Two years since i started programming. Did it work?<br>Can i call myself a programmer now? <br>Time to test that.<br>if i was able to create flyCoin , i can implement RSA right?<br>Yeah. i did. kind of . It actually does work how it is supposed to. just not with big numbers, atleast not for now.</br>


<h1>Test my shit?</h1>
<br> Run with : python3 rsa.py -e {string} </br>
<br> if you run it like this , it will encrypt that string and make private and public keys.</br>
<br> Run with : python3 rsa.py -d {string}  {private key} </br>
<br> if you run it like this , it will decrypt the string using private key and print it.</br>
